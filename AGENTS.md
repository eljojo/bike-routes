# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (e.g. Claude Code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

This is the **data repository** for [Ottawa by Bike](https://ottawabybike.ca) — a curated cycling guide for the National Capital Region. It contains structured cycling content (markdown, GPX tracks, YAML) organized by city. A separate [Astro app](https://github.com/eljojo/bike-app-astro) renders this data into a static website.

The vision is a "Wikipedia of bike routes" — community-driven, openly licensed, forkable.

**Trust is binary.** The app serves real people planning real bike rides. A cyclist looking at "Beechcliffe Park Path" when they're standing on a path that obviously parallels Greenbank Road thinks the app is broken. Not "slightly wrong" — broken. One wrong name and the user questions every other name. `bikepaths.yml` is the deliverable. The code, the tests, the pipeline — all exist to produce correct data. If you changed code but didn't regenerate and commit the data, the work isn't done.

## Content Conventions

### Routes
- Each route is a **directory** named by its slug (e.g., `routes/aylmer/`)
- `index.md` frontmatter: `name`, `status` (published/draft), `distance_km`, `tags`, `tagline`, `variants`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Slug is derived from the directory name — never stored in frontmatter
- Variants list references to GPX files with name, distance_km, and optional strava_url
- `media.yml` is a flat list of photos and videos in camera roll order, each with an immutable `key` (blob key for Cloudflare R2) and a mutable `handle` (human-readable, unique within route)
- Photos have: `type: photo`, `key`, `handle`, `caption`, `score`, `width`, `height`, optional `cover: true`
- Videos have: `type: video`, `key`, `handle`, `title`, `duration`, `width`, `height`, `orientation`

### Translations (i18n)
- Supported locales: `en-CA`, `fr-CA`
- Routes: `index.fr.md` overrides `name`, `tagline`, and body text; can add `slug` field for French URL
- Guides/pages: `{slug}.fr.md` alongside `{slug}.md`
- Places: `name_fr` field in frontmatter (no separate file)
- Tags: `tag-translations.yml` maps English tag → French label
- Only translated fields need to appear in the `.fr.md` file; everything else falls back to English

### Places
- Flat markdown files with frontmatter: `name`, `name_fr`, `category`, `lat`, `lng`, `status`, `address`, `website`, `google_maps_url`
- Categories defined in `config.yml` under `place_categories` (adventure, food, utility groups)

### Events & Organizers
- Events organized by year: `events/2025/event-slug.md`
- Event frontmatter: `name`, `start_date`, `start_time`, `end_date`, `end_time`, `location`, `registration_url`, `organizer`, `poster_key`
- Organizers: `name`, `website`, `instagram`

## Licensing

- Text (markdown): CC BY-SA 4.0
- Route data (GPX): ODbL 1.0
- Media: per-file licensing
- Everything else (YAML, scripts, tooling): Apache 2.0

## Bikepaths Pipeline (`scripts/build-bikepaths.mjs`)

### Anchors are NOT coordinates

`anchors` in bikepaths.yml are 1-2 bbox corner points used **only** for geographic scope in Overpass name lookups (`generate-route.mjs:fetchNamedWays`). They are NOT geometry. They are NOT suitable for:
- Determining if two entries are near each other
- Determining if an entry is "in" a park, neighbourhood, or region
- Any spatial analysis, distance calculation, or geographic reasoning

**If you need to know where something actually is, query Overpass for its real geometry.** The way coordinates from `out geom` queries are the source of truth. Anchors are a lossy summary that exists only to scope name-based lookups.

This is not a suggestion. Every time an AI has used anchors for spatial reasoning in this project, the result has been wrong. Do not do it.

### `_ways` is transient

The `_ways` field (full way geometry from Overpass) exists only in memory during the build. It is stripped before writing bikepaths.yml. It is never persisted. If you need way geometry after the build, query Overpass again.

### Clustering uses connectivity, not proximity

The auto-grouping in `scripts/lib/cluster-entries.mjs` merges entries whose OSM ways share nodes or have endpoints within ~10m. It does NOT use anchor distance. Guards: operator compatibility, path type (trail/paved/road), corridor width (2km).

### Markdown is the human override layer

`ottawa/bike-paths/*.md` files override and extend what the algorithm produces:
- `name` in frontmatter overrides the auto-generated group name
- `includes` lists bikepaths.yml slugs that should be shown on this page — use this to merge things the algorithm split (e.g. disconnected trail clusters that are conceptually one system)
- `member_of` assigns an entry to a network the algorithm didn't discover
- The algorithm does 80% of the work. Humans do the 20% via markdown.
- `includes` assignments must be verified geographically by querying Overpass for real way coordinates — never by name-matching, never by using anchors from bikepaths.yml

### Taxonomy: Networks vs Paths

- **Path** — a single named cycling corridor with its own geometry (a `bike_paths` entry in bikepaths.yml). Gets a page if it meets the destination rule.
- **Network** — a collection of paths forming a coherent system (`type: network` in bikepaths.yml, with a `members` array of path slugs). Comes from OSM `type=superroute` relations. Members keep their own pages; the network is an additional layer above them.
- **`members` vs `grouped_from`** — `members` (networks) is additive: children keep their pages. `grouped_from` (trail clusters) is reductive: children lose their pages, absorbed into the group. Auto-grouping skips network members to prevent collision.
- **Destination rule** — a path gets a standalone page only if length >= 1km. Below 1km, it appears on its parent network page but not as a standalone page. Markdown overrides both ways: a `.md` file forces a page; `hidden: true` suppresses one.
- **Primary network** — when a path belongs to multiple superroutes, the most specific/local one is primary. The path's URL nests under its primary network.
- **Only top-level superroutes become networks.** A sub-superroute (child of another superroute) is NOT a network — it's a path split into sections by OSM mappers. Example: Ottawa River Pathway is a sub-superroute of Capital Pathway with east/west/TCT children. To a cyclist it's one path. Its children get flattened into Capital Pathway as direct members. Minimum 2 members in the bbox to qualify as a network.

### bikepaths.yml is fully rewritten

bikepaths.yml is regenerated from scratch on every build. No incremental merge — the pipeline discovers all data from OSM, computes networks and groups, enriches with Wikidata, and writes the complete file. Manual additions (out-of-bounds relations not discoverable by bbox queries) are stored in `manual-entries.yml` and merged into the pipeline input. Human overrides (names, descriptions, operator labels) belong in the markdown layer, not in bikepaths.yml.

## Relationship to the Astro App

The Astro app references this repo via `CONTENT_DIR` env var (defaults to `../bike-routes`). The `CITY` env var selects which city folder to build (defaults to `ottawa`). The app uses custom content loaders to parse routes (GPX + media.yml), computes place-route proximity at build time, and generates static HTML. Changes to this repo trigger rebuilds via GitHub `repository_dispatch`.

GPX files are tracked with Git LFS.

## Context

This repo uses a two-tier context system mirroring `~/code/bike-app-astro`. The rules and conventions above are always active. The `_ctx/` files below contain detail for specific tasks — read the one-line description to decide if you need the full file.

### Rules
- [spatial-reasoning](_ctx/spatial-reasoning.md) — NEVER use midpoints, centers, anchors, or bboxes as proxy for real geometry

### Patterns
- [pipeline-overview](_ctx/pipeline-overview.md) — how build-bikepaths.mjs discovers, names, clusters, and networks cycling infrastructure
- [naming-unnamed-chains](_ctx/naming-unnamed-chains.md) — how Step 2c names unnamed chains from nearby parks/roads
- [markdown-overrides](_ctx/markdown-overrides.md) — how markdown frontmatter overrides pipeline-computed values

### Guides
- [context-system](_ctx/context-system.md) — how the _ctx/ system works, mirrors bike-app-astro

### Cross-Repo Context
- `~/code/bike-app-astro/_ctx/bike-paths.md` — how the Astro app consumes bikepaths.yml and markdown (overlay model, network pages, enrichment)
